Universal PDF Extraction & Comparison Toolkit ðŸš€
Overview
This repository brings together various PDF extraction tools (such as pdfplumber, Doctr, DocuPanda, pdf2image, PyMuPDF, and more) into a single platform. Our goal is to help developers compare and evaluate the performance of different PDF parsing solutions, saving time and enhancing productivity.

Why This Repository?
Extracting text and structured data from PDFs is a common but challenging task due to varying formats, layouts, and embedded elements like images and tables. With multiple tools available, it can be difficult to determine:
âœ… Which tool works best for your specific use case?
âœ… How do different extraction libraries compare in accuracy and efficiency?
âœ… Which tool offers the best speed vs. precision trade-off?

This repository provides a centralized framework for testing and benchmarking various PDF extraction solutions, making it easy for developers to choose the right tool for their needs.

Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction from PDFs â€“ Extract text, tables, and images from scanned or digital PDFs.
ðŸ”¹ Automated PDF Processing â€“ Preprocess and parse PDFs in bulk for analysis.
ðŸ”¹ OCR & Image-Based PDF Processing â€“ Convert scanned PDFs into structured text using OCR.
ðŸ”¹ Comparing Performance Metrics â€“ Evaluate speed, accuracy, and robustness across different tools.
ðŸ”¹ API-Driven PDF Parsing â€“ Integrate FastAPI-based backend solutions for seamless extraction.

How It Works
This repository includes:
âœ… A unified FastAPI backend for handling PDF uploads and parsing.
âœ… Support for multiple PDF extraction tools, allowing easy comparisons.
âœ… Performance benchmarks to assess speed and accuracy.
âœ… Prebuilt API endpoints for developers to integrate into their projects.
